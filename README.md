# Arduino Data collector and aggregator by Owen and Coen and Aly

## Overview
A system built for the Arduino R4 Wifi to work with the White Box T3 to interface with Atlas Scientific Sensors and send the data to a remote server over wifi.

## Features
- Interfaces with up to 5 Atlas Scientific sensors simultaneously
- Remotely connects to a database server over wifi
- Includes debugging functionality for connection between sensors that displays onto the Arduino R4 LED display

## Hardware Requirements
To implement the UCB, you will need the following hardware:

- __Arduino board__ (we are using an Arduino R4 Wifi)
- __T3 Whitebox__

## Getting Started

__Install Dependencies:__
Ensure that you have the necessary Arduino libraries installed. Refer to the documentation [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide) for details.

__Connect Hardware:__
Connect the servo motor to the designated pins on the Arduino board and ensure proper wiring with the ultrasonic cleaner.  

__Upload Code:__
Open the Arduino IDE, load the UCB code, and upload it to your Arduino board.
